Hello, this is the game 2200AD by Kristin Ho, Crystal Lam, Stefaney Guelmo and Larry Shen. 
The story is:
  In the year 2200 AD, the Earth experienced an alien invasion like no other.
		People lost their ability to reason and assumed monstrous forms. Those
		who survived fled into the galaxy.
		Having lost your parents in the chaos, you and your little sister boarded
		a refugee craft destined to cruise aimlessly in the galaxy, searching for
		contact with other refugee crafts. While volunteering for crew duty in the
		middle of the night, your refugee craft came under attack by the same
		aggressors that attacked your planet. Once again, your fellow crew and
		passengers assumed monstrous forms.
		You've told your little sister to lock the door and stay in her room.
		Between you and her are four rooms, each ocked with different contraptions.
		Your objective is to get your sister and escape to the escape pod. Both of
		you must get to the escape pod. Good luck.

Hint for the first level: Type in the code by the door rather than click on the keypad with your mouse.

Here's a playable version:
