INSTRUCTIONS
------------
(1) All these puzzles use raycast
(2) Make sure main camera is still tagged as "main camera" (default setting)
(3) You may need to resize my models according to the room size in Maya
(4) I added Crystal's materials and models in ROOM MODELS in ASSETS. Everything she had
    on her github branch in the ASSETS folder on 8/9/2014 at 7:00PM is in there, 
    including scripts


SWITCH PUZZLE
-------------
(1) Add the SWITCHES script to any object, where you will easily find it
(2) Place and size six copies of the SWITCH MERGED model anywhere in your scene
(3) Make sure all the switches are pointing in the same direction (up or down)
(4) Rename the switches 1-6 for your viewing and organizing convenience
(5) Place and size two copies of the SCIFI DOOR model in your scene. Rename one of the 
    doors as "entrance" Note: we can attach code to this door when we add the hallways
(6) The other door is the "exit" door which only opens with the puzzle
    Make sure you do NOT combine the pieces. There should be four:
    (1) Door_Top
    (2) Door_Right
    (3) Door_Left
    (4) Door_Frame (irrelevant)
(7) Door_Top, Door_Right, Door_Left all need a MESH collider. Assign the colliders
    to their corresponding names on the script component in the inspector
(8) Add a MESH collider to each of the six switch models in your scene. Assign them in 
    any order in the script component in the inspector. 
(9) Click the arrow next to SWITCH ORDER in the script component in the inspector. Size
    should already be listed as 6, but if not, put 6. 
(10) Assign the six switch colliders in the order you please in the array SWITCH ORDER
    in the inspector. **This will be the order the user will need to hit the switches 
    in order to open the door**
(11) If you need to see how it's done, see the SWITCH scene in EXAMPLES folder in ASSETS


COLLECTOR PUZZLE
----------------
(1) Add the COLLECTOR script to any object, where you will easily find it
(2) **Obtain the EYEBALL model and texture from Larry**
(3) Place and size the KEYCARD SPLIT model and Larry's EYEBALL model anywhere in scene
(4) **You need to split and regroup the KEYCARD SPLIT model into the RIGHT and LEFT parts
    It has already been labelled as RIGHT or LEFT. Simply regroup them**
(5) When you colour the KEYCARD SPLIT model, note there are 3 colourable parts: 
    (1) The magnetic strip, which is a plane. Should probably be black
    (2) The card itself
    (3) The text "I.G.A" 
(6) Don't forget to apply Larry's texture to the EYEBALL model
(7) Add a MESH collider to Larry's EYEBALL model and the KEYCARD SPLIT models
(8) Place and size two copies of the SCIFI DOOR model in your scene. Rename one of the 
    doors as "entrance" Note: we can attach code to this door when we add the hallways
(9) The other door is the "exit" door which only opens with the puzzle
    Make sure you do NOT combine the pieces. There should be four:
    (1) Door_Top
    (2) Door_Right
    (3) Door_Left
    (4) Door_Frame (irrelevant)
(10) Door_Top, Door_Right, Door_Left all need a MESH collider. Assign the colliders
    to their corresponding names on the script component in the inspector
(11) Assign PIECE ONE, PIECE TWO, and PIECE THREE in the script component in the inspector
    to the RIGHT KEYCARD, LEFT KEYCARD, and EYEBALL. Order doesn't matter
(12) If you need to see how it's done, see the COLLECTOR scene in EXAMPLES folder in ASSETS


KEYCARD PUZZLE
--------------
(1) Add the KEYPAD script to any object, where you will easily find it
(2) Place and size the KEYPAD model anywhere in your scene
(3) When you colour the KEYPAD model, note there are lots of colourable parts:
    (1) The keypad screen, a plane object labelled SCREEN in the prefab
    (2) The keypad itself, labelled PAD in the prefab
    (3) The face of the keys, 9 planes in total, each labelled as KEY_?_FACE
    (4) The keys' numerical representation, 9 in total from 1-9, labelled  KEY_?_TEXT
(4) **ONLY THE PAD NEEDS A MESH COLLIDER. NOTHING ELSE** Any other colliders in front of
    the pad will interfere with the code and the puzzle will not work
(5) Place and resize a 3D text in front of the screen
(6) Place and size two copies of the SCIFI DOOR model in your scene. Rename one of the 
    doors as "entrance" Note: we can attach code to this door when we add the hallways
(7) The other door is the "exit" door which only opens with the puzzle
    Make sure you do NOT combine the pieces. There should be four:
